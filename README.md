Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) Terraform Template
This Terraform template defines an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) with two node pools, each configured with specific properties. It also generates a local Kubernetes configuration file (kubeconfig).

Prerequisites
Before using this Terraform template, ensure the following prerequisites are met:

Azure CLI: Install and configure the Azure Command-Line Interface (CLI) with the necessary access credentials.

Terraform: Install Terraform on your machine.

Configuration
Update the variables in the variables.tf file to match your environment:

clustername: Name of the AKS cluster.
location: Azure region where the AKS cluster will be created.
resource_group_name: Name of the Azure resource group.
kubernetes_version: Desired Kubernetes version for the AKS cluster.
default_node_count: Number of nodes in the default node pool.
vm_size: Virtual machine size for the nodes.
client_id: Client ID of the service principal for AKS.
client_secret: Client secret of the service principal for AKS.
node_pool1_name: Name of the first node pool.
node_pool2_name: Name of the second node pool.
Other variables for node pool configurations.

Terraform Backend Configuration
The backend.tf file configures the Terraform backend to store the state in Azure Storage:

storage_account_name: Azure Storage Account name.
resource_group_name: Azure resource group for the storage account.
container_name: Azure Storage container for storing Terraform state.
key: Name of the Terraform state file.
Azure Provider Configuration
The provider "azurerm" block configures the Azure provider:

required_version: Minimum required version of Terraform.
source: Source of the azurerm provider.
version: Version constraints for the azurerm provider.
Helm Provider Configuration
The provider "helm" block configures the Helm provider to interact with the AKS cluster:

host: Kubernetes API server host from the AKS cluster.
client_certificate: Decoded client certificate from the AKS cluster kubeconfig.
client_key: Decoded client key from the AKS cluster kubeconfig.
cluster_ca_certificate: Decoded cluster CA certificate from the AKS cluster kubeconfig.

Outputs
This Terraform template generates a local Kubernetes configuration file (kubeconfig) in the module directory.

Notes
Ensure that the Azure service principal (specified by var.client_id and var.client_secret) has the necessary permissions to create AKS resources.

Customize the Terraform template as needed, such as adjusting node pool configurations or adding additional resources.

This template uses spot instances for the node pools, which may have cost implications. Adjust the priority and eviction_policy accordingly.

Ensure secure handling of sensitive information like client secrets.

Customize the Terraform template as needed, such as adjusting backend configurations or Helm provider settings.

This template assumes that the AKS cluster has been provisioned using a separate Terraform configuration.

Handle sensitive information (e.g., client certificates, keys) securely.


Feel free to adapt the template based on your specific requirements and security considerations.
